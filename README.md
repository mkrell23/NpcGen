# Generic NPC Generator

### Create new D&D NPCs on the fly, quickly by answering a few questions about race, class, and level

---
This console app is intended to remove the tedium of creating NPCs for a campaign, a labor intensive necessity for any DM.

#### Projected Features and Use Flow

1. Select desired base class
    * Class determines base stats distribution, using the standard array of stats (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8) and allocating them according to the optimal use for class (ie. Wizards get strength of 8 while a fighter gets strength of 15, which is swapped for intelligence.)
2. Select desired race
    * Race adds certain bonuses and effects such as movement in a turn and abilities like darkvision.
3. Add levels to character
    * Levels may increase stat points, add potential spells, or give options for branching upgrade paths.
4. Save and load character
5. Add more levels so the bad guy can make a comeback

Currently only focusing on basic rule 5e races and classes with the intention to expand to supplemental books. Multiclass ability is also planned to be added.
