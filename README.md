# Generic NPC Generator

### Create new D&D NPCs on the fly, quickly by answering a few questions about race, class, and level

---
This console app is intended to remove the tedium of creating NPCs for a campaign, a labor intensive necessity for any DM.

#### Projected Features and Use Flow

1. Select desired class
    * Class determines stats distribution, allocating them according to the optimal use for class (ie. Wizards get strength of 8 while a fighter gets strength of 15, which is swapped for intelligence.)
    * Rolls dice, and distributes them as above.
2. Select desired race
    * Race adds certain bonuses and effects such as movement in a turn and abilities like darkvision.
3. Add levels to character
    * Levels may increase stat points, add potential spells, or give options for branching upgrade paths.
4. Save and load character
5. Add more levels so the bad guy can make a comeback

Currently only basic rule 5e races and classes due to copyright. Multiclass ability is planned to be added, as well as monster race characters.
