General Program Flow:

* Get input from user:
    (class, race, level, optional name, optional prestige)

* Search API for class/prestige at level
* Find Spells for class at level
* Find race traits
* Roll virtual dice to generate stats
* Distribute stats in class-determined priority (highest stat for wizards is inteligence, but for barbarians it's strength, etc)
* Combine everything into a character

* Display character:
    Base stats (able to rearange and reroll)
    Spell selection available and amount usable
    Race characterists and modifiers
    Class/prestige abilities and modifiers (feats, etc available?)
    All the other calculated bits for the character sheet that aren't narritive based

* Save/Load Character

* Add other levels to character?


NEXT:

Character Class:
** Mockup quick auto-picking function for now:
* For each API result with a choice add ability to chose and add results to object
* Ability to chose proficiencies, spells, equipment, etc
* Display entire character to the user
* Add calculated getters for things like ability bonuses (is needed with how I'm doing things?)

Main App:
* Add ability to save genrated character - Pass the promise in somehow...
* Add ability to load previous character
* Add ability to add levels to character
* (LOW PRIORITY) Add a subclass/subrace checkbox, blank to start, populated "onchange" from class/race selection
