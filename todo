General Program Flow:

* Get input from user:
    (class, race, level, optional name, optional prestige)

* Search API for class/prestige at level
* Find Spells for class at level
* Find race traits
* Roll virtual dice to generate stats
* Distribute stats in class-determined priority (highest stat for wizards is inteligence, but for barbarians it's strength, etc)
* Combine everything into a character

* Display character:
    Base stats (able to rearange and reroll)
    Spell selection available and amount usable
    Race characterists and modifiers
    Class/prestige abilities and modifiers (feats, etc available?)
    All the other calculated bits for the character sheet that aren't narritive based

* Save/Load Character

* Add other levels to character?


NEXT:
* Create character class
* Populate character object from API calls and ability score rolls
* Character display to user
* (LOW PRIORITY) Add a subclass/subrace checkbox, blank to start, populated "onchange" from class/race selection

* CSS: on small screens selections should be single list down page
* Larger screens: 200% more padding between elements
